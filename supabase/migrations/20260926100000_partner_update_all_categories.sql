-- APPLIED 2026-09-26 via the SQL editor (fixed "Mise a jour refusee" for a
-- gift-shop partner). Overlaps with 20260925200000_partner_order_writes_all_
-- categories.sql (not executed at the time), which fixes the same policy
-- plus the guard_orders_column_scope trigger. If that one is run later, its
-- orders_partner_update replaces this one; the two are equivalent in effect.
--
-- Let partners of every category accept their own orders
-- ============================================================================
-- `orders_partner_update` was written when only two verticals existed. Its
-- USING/WITH CHECK clauses match a partner row whose partner_type is exactly
-- 'restaurant' or 'supermarket':
--
--     restaurant_id IN (SELECT entity_id FROM partners
--                       WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
--                         AND partner_type = 'restaurant')
--     OR supermarket_id IN (... partner_type = 'supermarket')
--
-- A florist, pet shop, bakery, gift shop or electronics store signs up with
-- partner_type = 'flowers' | 'pets' | 'bakery' | 'gifts' | 'electronics', so
-- NEITHER branch matches. Row-level security then silently blocks the UPDATE:
-- no error is raised, the statement simply affects zero rows.
--
-- The effect, seen in the partner app: tapping "Accepter" appears to do
-- nothing. The order stays Pending forever, and because the driver dispatch
-- runs from an AFTER UPDATE OF status trigger, no driver is ever notified.
--
-- This rewrites the policy to key on the entity id alone. Which column the
-- order used (restaurant_id or supermarket_id) and which category the partner
-- sells are both irrelevant to the question being asked: does this order
-- belong to the venue this user owns?

begin;

-- Compared as TEXT on purpose, with entity_id cast explicitly. The repo's
-- schema file declares partners.entity_id TEXT, but the live column is uuid:
-- a bare `entity_id <> ''` made Postgres parse '' as a uuid and fail with
-- 22P02 before the policy was even created. Casting entity_id to text first
-- works for either column type, and a text comparison can never throw at
-- query time. Both order id columns are checked (rather than coalesce) so an
-- order carrying both still matches whichever venue owns it.

-- Same blind spot on SELECT: a gift-shop partner could not even read their
